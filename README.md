# Bruteforce

**Bruteforce** is a Python-based tool designed for performing brute-force attacks on website login pages. This repository includes a script that automates the process of testing login forms with a list of usernames and passwords to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It leverages Selenium to interact with web elements and simulate user actions.

## üîç Features

- **Automated Brute-Force Attacks:** Test login forms by attempting multiple username and password combinations.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Configure the script to target specific login fields and adjust attack parameters.
- **Detailed Logging:** Output results for each login attempt, including successes and failures.
- **URL Verification:** Check for changes in the URL to determine if a login attempt was successful based on a specific success indicator.
